## Code Structure & Optimization

- **All logic is centralized in `dashboard.jsx`**: Handles state, tab switching, real-time updates, and data fetching.
- **Helpers, constants, and data fetching** are modularized in `lib/helpers.js`, `lib/constants.js`, and `lib/data.js`.
- **No unnecessary files**: All code is DRY, and unused files/components have been removed.
- **UI components**: All UI logic is in the `components/` directory, with reusable subcomponents for cards, tables, and badges.
- **Real-time**: Uses Supabase subscriptions for live updates.
- **No dead code**: All code is used and maintained.

## Database Schema

The dashboard connects to a Supabase table named `equities_data` with the following columns:

- `SYMBOL` - Stock symbol
- `COMPANY NAME` - Company name
- `SUBJECT` - Announcement subject
- `DETAILS` - Announcement details
- `BROADCAST DATE/TIME` - Broadcast timestamp
- `RECEIPT` - Receipt ID
- `DISSEMINATION` - Dissemination info
- `DIFFERENCE` - Time difference
- `ATTACHMENT` - Attachment URL
- `FILE SIZE` - File size
- `BROADCAST DATE/TIME` - Record creation timestamp

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15** - React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Supabase** - Database and real-time data
- **Lucide React** - Icons
- **Date-fns** - Date formatting

## Data Source

This dashboard displays data from your Supabase database. The data is populated by your separate NSE sync script that fetches corporate announcements from the NSE API and stores them in the `equities_data` table.
